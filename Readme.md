# About
Latest version of my CV, typesetted in Calibri and using colors inspired by Monokai (there is an `print` option which renders in black and white, and reverts the header to dark on light, if printing on paper is needed).

Uses TikZ for the header, XeTeX and fontspec to use Calibri, biblatex to print my publications and textpos for the aside.


This is edited README from Friggeri CV template.
